# Landing Page for BOTTE MICIDIALI

This is hosted directly here with GitHub Pages at https://gesucca-official.github.io/bm-landing-page/, while the real app lives at https://botte-micidiali.herokuapp.com/.

## What? This does not look like a landing page at all!

Yeah, you're right.

This is just a tracer piece of environment, in the same metaphor which inspire the tracer code methodlogy. For now, it serves the sole purpose of being there to immediately redirect people the main app, but it is ready to be extended into what will be needed.
